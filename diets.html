<h3>Bulking</h3>
<p2>Bulking is a term that bodybuilders frequently use. It's a combination of a gradual increase in the quantity of calories taken above your body's demands and intensive weight exercise. Some argue that bulking is unhealthy, while others argue that it is a safe and effective way to develop muscle mass.</p2>
<h4>Clean Bulk</font></h4>
<p2>Clean bulking is a diet that delivers a controlled calorie surplus to help you increase muscle and strength while avoiding unnecessary fat gain. Athletes who can't afford to gain too much fat while trying to increase muscle often use this strategy.</p2>
<h4>Dirty Bulk</text></h4>
<p2>To promote rapid weight growth, a filthy bulk often involves eating a lot of excess calories from high-calorie foods, especially junk foods. A clean bulk involves a reasonable increase in calories and the use of healthier foods.</p2>

It is recommended to take protein when you start at the gym but if you don want to buy it all the months, you can take in clean bulking because is very helpful for your muscles.</p2>
